<img src="logo.jpg" alt="BikeControl Logo"/>

## Description

With BikeControl you can **control your favorite trainer app** using your Zwift Click, Zwift Ride, Zwift Play, Shimano Di2, or other similar devices. Here's what you can do with it, depending on your configuration:
- Add Virtual Shifting for trainer apps that do not support it natively
- Adjust Virtual Shifting to your liking: change the number of gears, adjust the gear ratios, and more
- Steering / navigation
- adjust workout intensity
- control music on your device
- create screenshots or launch any command / shortcut
- gestures: single click, double click, long press, etc. can be configured to do different things
- more? If you can do it via keyboard, mouse, or touch, you can do it with BikeControl

You can also connect your smart trainer directly to BikeControl to:
- Add virtual shifting capability if your trainer app doesn't support it
- Adjust virtual shifting gears to your liking
- Direct gear / intensity / mode changes via your controller
- Start a mini workout
- Proxy to WiFi

## Supported Platforms

Follow the "Get Started" button over at [bikecontrol.app](https://bikecontrol.app) to understand on which platform you want to run BikeControl.
You can even try it out in your [Browser](https://openbikecontrol.github.io/bikecontrol/), if it supports Bluetooth connections. No controlling possible, though.

## Help
Check the troubleshooting guide [here](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## How does it work?
The app connects to your Controller devices (such as Zwift ones) automatically. BikeControl uses different methods of connecting to the trainer app, depending on the trainer app and operating system:
- Connect to the trainer app on the same device or on another device using Network
    - available on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows
    - supported by e.g. MyWhoosh, Rouvy and Zwift
- Connect to the trainer app on another device by simulating a Bluetooth device
  - available on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows
  - supported by e.g. Rouvy and Zwift
- Directly control the trainer app via Accessibility features (simulating touch and keyboard input)
  - available on Android, macOS, Windows
  - supported by all trainer apps
- Connect to the supported trainer app using the [OpenBikeControl](https://openbikecontrol.org) protocol
  - available on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenBikeControl/bikecontrol.git
cd bikecontrol
flutter pub get

# The localization accessors under lib/gen/ are generated, not committed.
flutter pub global activate intl_utils
flutter pub global run intl_utils:generate

flutter build apk --debug          # or: flutter run
```

### About the `prop` submodule

`.gitmodules` references a private `prop` repository. **You do not need it, and
`git submodule update --init` is expected to fail for you** — leave it
uninitialised.

`prop` holds the trainer/controller emulator implementations, which are not
open source. If you want to have a look at it, contact me :) 
The repository ships `prop_public/`, an API-compatible stub of the
same package, and `pubspec.yaml` points at it. A clone therefore builds,
analyzes and runs against the stub without any extra setup.

What that means in practice: the app launches and the UI, settings,
localization and non-emulator code are all fully buildable and hackable, but
the stubbed calls are inert, so trainer emulation and virtual shifting do not
actually do anything in a build made this way. If you need the full
implementation, get in touch.

Release APKs are signed with a key that is not in the repository. When
`android/keystore.properties` is absent the release build falls back to the
debug key, so `flutter build apk --release` works from a plain clone.

`flutter test` runs, except for 11 of the 297 test files which exercise the
emulator implementations themselves and import test seams from `prop`. Those
need the private package; the rest of the suite does not.
