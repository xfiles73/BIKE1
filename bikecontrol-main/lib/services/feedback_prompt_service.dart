/// Decides when the "how's it going" feedback bottom sheet is allowed to
/// appear.
///
/// ## What counts as a session
/// A session starts the moment any [trainerConnections] entry flips to
/// connected, and ends only once every one of them is disconnected again.
/// By the time a session ends, it counts toward [successfulSessionThreshold]
/// only if BOTH hold:
///  - it lasted at least [minSessionDuration] — a dropped BLE link or a
///    rider backing out of setup isn't real usage, and
///  - at least one command was actually delivered to the trainer app during
///    it (see [recordCommandDelivered]) — being connected isn't the same as
///    having pressed a button.
///
/// The counter is incremented — and [shouldShowPrompt] re-checked — on
/// session END, never on session START. That ordering is also what keeps the
/// rider from ever seeing the sheet mid-ride: [_isEligible] refuses while a
/// session is active, so [shouldShowPrompt] is forced back to `false` the
/// instant a session starts and only re-evaluated once every trainer has
/// disconnected. Whether the overview screen happens to be on screen at that
/// moment is the caller's job, not this service's — see
/// `FeedbackPromptTrigger` / `OverviewPage`.
///
/// ## Rebase from the old review banner
/// This replaces a connection-COUNTING scheme that bumped a counter on the
/// first trainer connection of a launch and fired as soon as it (and a few
/// other gates) crossed a threshold — including while the rider was still
/// connecting, not after any real usage. That old counter,
/// `review_session_count`, pre-dates this feature entirely (the old
/// star-rating banner used the same key), so existing installs were already
/// far past any reasonable threshold the moment this shipped.
///
/// [Settings.getFeedbackSuccessfulSessionCount] is a brand new key that
/// starts at 0 for every install, existing users included — nothing in this
/// file reads `review_session_count` or
/// `review_dismissed_at_session_count` again. `review_completed` is the one
/// legacy signal still honoured ([markCompleted] hard-stops on it): someone
/// who already rated the app must never be asked again, regardless of how
/// that flag got set. `review_dismissed_at_session_count` — the old snooze
/// marker — is deliberately left alone: it was measured against the old
/// counter's scale (comparing it against the new counter would be
/// meaningless) and it never carried a timestamp, so it can't answer the
/// new dismissal cooldown's day-based arm either. A rider who dismissed the
/// old banner gets the same clean ramp as anyone else under the new rules.
