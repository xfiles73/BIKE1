/// [BleSensorSource] — a heart rate strap, a cadence sensor, or a power
/// meter (`BleHeartRateDevice`, `BleCadenceDevice`, `BlePowerDevice`).
///
/// [Connection] and `SensorQuantitySelector` need to reach ANY sensor of
/// this shape without caring which concrete type it is. Before this existed,
/// both were gated on `is! BleHeartRateDevice` specifically — which meant a
/// cadence sensor or power meter could be discovered and classified by
/// `BluetoothDevice.fromScanResult`, but could never actually be connected
/// (nothing listed it as selectable) and, even if something else had
/// connected it, its source would never reach `SensorHub` (the registration
/// gate dropped it). A second `is BleCadenceDevice || is BlePowerDevice`
/// check would have papered over that specific gap while leaving the exact
/// same trap for the next sensor type; a shared interface does not.

  /// the second half every relaunch would grab the strap (most allow one
  /// connection) away from the rider's watch with Broadcast off and nothing
  /// advertised. Trainer mode is unchanged: the bridge relies on the
  /// launch-time reconnect. Spec, Global Constraint: "Nothing connects a
