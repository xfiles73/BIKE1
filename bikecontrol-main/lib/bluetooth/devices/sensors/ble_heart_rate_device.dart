/// A standards-compliant heart rate strap paired directly to BikeControl.
///
/// Transport only: discover, subscribe, and hand bytes to [source]. The source
/// owns parsing, and the hub above it owns whether this reading is the one the
/// rider actually wants. No buttons: a strap has nothing for the rider to
/// click, so it is registered with an empty [availableButtons] like the other
/// non-controller accessories in this directory.
///
/// `with Accessory`: a strap reacts to nothing and sends nothing a rider binds
/// to a button, same as a Headwind or Climb. Without the mixin, `Connection`
/// remembers it as `RememberedDeviceKind.controller` instead of excluding it
/// the way it does every other accessory, and its settings page renders an
/// empty Button Mapping table.
///
/// `with BleSensorDevice`: the shared surface `Connection` and
/// `SensorQuantitySelector` dispatch on so a strap, a cadence sensor and a
/// power meter can all be reached the same way — see that mixin's doc
/// comment.
