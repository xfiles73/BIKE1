## Instructions for using the MyWhoosh "Link" connection method
*
1) Launch MyWhoosh on the device of your choice
2) Only needed once: open the "MyWhoosh Link" app on the same device where you want to use BikeControl. Make sure the Link app is able to connect to MyWhoosh. If it does, close MyWhoosh Link.
3) Make sure the "MyWhoosh Link" app is not active at the same time as BikeControl
4) Open BikeControl, enable the Link connection method, and follow the on-screen instructions


Here's a video with a few explanations. Note that it uses an older version, but the idea is the same.

## MyWhoosh "Link" method never connects
*
This is a network/local-discovery problem. BikeControl needs the same kind of local network access as MyWhoosh Link.

Checklist:
- **iOS / macOS: check the Local Network permission first.** Without it every Link connection fails silently — nothing is logged, the app just never appears.
  - iOS: Settings → BikeControl → Local Network
  - macOS: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Local Network
  - BikeControl checks this itself and offers to open the right page, but the toggle can be revoked later (and on macOS it is sometimes lost across a reboot).
- Use the MyWhoosh Link app to confirm if "Link" works in general
- Use MyWhoosh Link app and connect, then close it, then open up BikeControl - this is key for some users
- Both devices (if you use BikeControl on another device than MyWhoosh) are on the **same Wi‑Fi SSID**
  - Avoid “Guest” networks
  - Avoid “extenders/mesh guest mode” and networks with device isolation
- If your router has it, disable:
  - “AP isolation / client isolation”
- Try moving both devices to the same band:
  - Prefer **2.4 GHz** (often more reliable for local discovery than mixed/steering)
- Temporarily disable:
  - VPNs
  - iCloud Private Relay (if enabled)
  - “Limit IP Address Tracking” (iOS Wi‑Fi option)
- iOS Wi‑Fi settings for that network:
  - Turn off **Private Wi‑Fi Address**
  - Turn off **Limit IP Address Tracking**
- Mesh networks: may work, but if it doesn’t, test with a simple router or phone hotspot.
