### 7.1.0 (29-09-2026)
**Features**:
- Smoother first-time setup, with a clearer Help Center and support flow.
- Accessibility: all buttons are labelled for screen readers, toasts are read aloud, touch targets on phones are larger, and "Reduce motion" is respected.
- A refreshed light and dark theme that's easier to read.

**Fixes**:
- Home: a trainer that is still connecting no longer briefly shows "lost connection".
- Text on phones is a more comfortable size, and the last English-only text is now translated.
- Faster home screen and workout history.

### 7.0.0 (18-09-2026)
**Features**:
- Sensors: pair a heart-rate strap, cadence sensor or power meter and choose, per signal, whether your trainer app gets the trainer's reading or the sensor's, over the one Bridge connection you already have.
- AirPods Pro 3 & Apple Watch heart rate (iOS 26) flows from Apple Health into your trainer app. No strap needed.
- Save rides to Apple Health (iOS, Pro): with a smart trainer connected, BikeControl records your ride on its own and saves it to Apple Health as an indoor cycling workout with power, cadence, speed, distance, heart rate and energy — for MyWhoosh, TrainingPeaks Virtual, Apple TV setups and any other app that doesn't write to Health itself.
- New Sensors page: broadcast "BikeControl" over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, so Zwift on an Apple TV or MyWhoosh on a PC pairs it like a strap, trainer or not.
- Better virtual shifting from a real cadence sensor: an external cadence sensor feeds virtual shifting directly, which sharpens it on trainers with a poor cadence signal and makes it work on trainers that report none at all.
- Shift feedback: optional sound and vibration on this phone or tablet on every shift, with a distinct cue when you reach the last gear.

**Fixes**:
- Smart trainers: trainers with no cadence signal (ThinkRider XX Pro and others) get a felt step on every gear that holds; the ThinkRider ramp follows your gear ratios; Tacx Neo appears on Windows; improved compatibility with more FTMS and Zwift Ready trainers under virtual shifting.
- Resistance self-test runs on trainers that report no cadence and keeps its step-by-step log in the support bundle.
- TrainerRoad: the Bridge now pairs with and is controlled by TrainerRoad over the network.

### 6.6.0 (31-08-2026)

- Improved compatibility with Zwift Ready & FTMS smart trainers
- Desktop floating overlay: a new 20-100% opacity slider lets you fade it over your trainer app.

**Fixes**:
- Rouvy: Zwift Ride D-pad up/down and left/right now navigate menus over the network, your gear and shifting are no longer overridden by Rouvy's own gear stream, and the trainer's FTMS service is back in Rouvy's device list.
- Android gear overlay: it now closes when you close the app, keeps the screen awake during a ride, and re-tops itself when a trainer app comes to the front.
- Zwift Ride: no more false "update firmware" prompt on a healthy unit.
- Zwift Click V2: one press now triggers exactly one action in Zwift.
- Improved network recovery when e.g. your internal IP changes

  - shifting on Zwift Ready trainers now feels instant
  - more FTMS trainers are supported
  - a new resistance test lets you confirm your trainer really responds

### 6.4.0 (10-08-2026)
**Features**:
- Added a guided setup on first launch
- Zwift Click V2: a new full-screen explainer lets you choose your unlock mode when the controller is first discovered — right side only (no Zwift unlock and no restarts, ever) or unlock with Zwift (both controllers, re-unlock every 24 hours). Picking the right side also remaps it so ＋ shifts up and B shifts down, since one puck now covers both directions.
- Trainer connection: a new "Help me decide" link explains the connect modes before you pick one.

**Fixes**:
- Accessories (Headwind, KICKR Climb) now appear on the main screen, so one that isn't yours — a neighbour's fan picked up through the wall — can be opened and put on the ignored list.

### 6.2.0 (26-06-2026)
**Features**:
- Virtual front derailleur: adds a second chainring (2× drivetrain) for more realism. The new assignable "Front Shift (Chainring)" action toggles between your small and large rings, changing resistance by the exact chainring ratio while staying on the same rear cog.
- SRAM style shifting: when you click shift up & down at the same time, the front chainring switches
- iOS / iPadOS: Floating gear overlay (Picture-in-Picture): your current gear can now show in a floating window over your trainer app during a ride.
- Screen recording: a new assignable "Record Screen" action starts a screen recording from a controller button.

### 6.1.0 (19-06-2026)
**Features**:
- WiFi enabled Smart Trainers are now supported
