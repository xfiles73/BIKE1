// Feedback-routing round: the trainer-feedback buttons on the smart-trainer
// details page ("No difference"/"Not working") used to open a support chat
// directly, prefilled with the tapped label — see proxy_device_details.dart.
// They now route through HelpCenterPage's "Your setup" section instead, but
// the rich diagnostic payload the chat used to get (a screenshot, a
// trainer-specific TelemetrySnapshot builder) must still reach
// SupportChatPage if the rider continues from there into "Tell us what's
// wrong" — ContactCommunitySection uses this value object for that handoff
// instead of gathering its own generic payload from scratch.
//
// Review round: dropped `feedbackKey` — it was threaded through three
// widgets and never read by any production code (the key already reaches
// support inside [telemetryBuilder]'s freetext) — and `diagnosticPreviewFuture`
// as a stored field, since deriving it from [telemetryBuilder] at the point
// [ContactCommunitySection] actually opens the chat is what lets that first
// call be the one and only trigger for the (slow, mDNS-scanning) gather —
// see [telemetryBuilder]'s own doc and `memoizeAsync`.
