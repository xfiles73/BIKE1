/// [device] is optional so this section also works in standalone mode — a

/// it resolves to a value, and the trainer is the fallback both when nothing
/// is selected and when a selection has gone stale — see `_quantityCard`.

/// before this feature existed: "--" and nothing else, no new affordance.
/// [_sourceOptionsFor] enforces this by returning null (no control at all)

///     side-by-side/stacked source-list switch. `LayoutBuilder` explicitly
///     refuses intrinsic queries — see its own source
///     (`_RenderLayoutBuilder._debugThrowIfNotCheckingIntrinsics`): "does
///     not support returning intrinsic dimensions", because answering would
///     mean running its builder speculatively against a hypothetical width.
///     So `IntrinsicHeight` here throws on EVERY tile that has grown a
///     source list — proven by pumping a minimal `IntrinsicHeight` +
///     `LayoutBuilder` reproduction under `flutter_test` before writing
///     this — not just under the unbounded-height page below.
///  2. Separately, `CrossAxisAlignment.stretch` needs the row's OWN
///     incoming height to be bounded (it tightens every child to
///     `constraints.maxHeight`), so it throws under an unbounded-height
///     parent — and this section renders inside a `SingleChildScrollView`
///     on both of its real call sites.
///
/// This class avoids both failure modes by never touching the intrinsics
/// protocol at all: [_RenderEqualHeightRow] runs the ordinary `RenderFlex`
/// layout once for real (exactly what a plain `Row` already does — safe for
/// `LayoutBuilder`, and safe unbounded, since nothing here needs the
/// incoming height to be finite), reads the row's own resulting height off
/// that, and then, only for a child shorter than that, lays that ONE child
/// out again for real with a tight height matching the row. Every layout
/// call is a genuine `RenderBox.layout()`, never an intrinsic-dimension
